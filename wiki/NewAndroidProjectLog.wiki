= Solved issues =

 * the 'R' class (R.java) is an auto generated file which is often not created by the Eclipse staff because of missing preconditions you have to provide:
{{{
// for every 'final class XY' entry in 'R.java'
//  you need to have a file 'res/<XY>/<entry>.xml' in place
//
// for example:
//  if 'R.java' shall have a section 'public static final class layout'
//   covering for example 'public static final int activity_main'
//  then you need to have a file 'res/layout/activity_main.xml' in place.
}}}
