= Details =

 * Eclipse Kepler etc. ...
 * New Project - Android Application Project
{{{
Application Name = <My Application Name>
Project Name = <MyApplicationName>_by_appgemacht
Package Name = com.appgemacht.<myapplicationname>
}}}
   (note: the usage of upper and lower case letters !)

 * A step-by-step howto: http://www.androidpit.de/de/android/wiki/view/Android_Anf%C3%A4nger_Workshop#toc171

= Solved issues =

 * the 'R' class (R.java) is an auto generated file which is often not created by the Eclipse staff because of missing preconditions you have to provide:
{{{
// for every 'final class XY' entry in 'R.java'
//  you need to have a file 'res/<XY>/<entry>.xml' in place
//
// for example:
//  if 'R.java' shall have a section 'public static final class layout'
//   covering for example 'public static final int activity_main'
//  then you need to have a file 'res/layout/activity_main.xml' in place.
}}}
 * Missing Library can be added physically under {{project}}/libs

 * Starting the APP may cause  an issue like 'Could not find (Library).apk'; that helped out: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16736452/could-not-find-actionbarsherlock-apk

 * The former tip did not completely solve the issue: APP still crashed with error `'Unable to instantiate activity ComponentInfo {org.<XYZ>/org.<XYZ>.BizTownActivity}`. Solution was found here: http://rip747.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/android-java-lang-runtimeexception-unable-to-instantiate-activity-componentinfo/ in .classpath file the following entry was missing:
{{{
 <classpathentry kind="src" path="src"/>
}}}
